    Brief Statement of the Problem:
    \end{flushleft}

    \noindent
    Preventing adversarial implementations of storage systems require 
    confidentiality specifications. Current specifications have weaker guarantees when it comes to nondeterministic events. This thesis proposes a new definition that addresses weaknesses as well as a framework for proving confidentiality of software systems in a modular and composable manner.
