\section{Limitations}
Limitations of my thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ConFrm does not model side-channels like timing attacks. Therefore its guarantees do not cover side-channel attacks.
	
	\item Our evaluation stops at file system boundary and do not include applications built on top of it. However, there is no fundamental reason that makes ConFrm unusable in application domain.
\end{itemize}
