\section{Contributions}

The contributions of my thesis, subject to this proposal, will be:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A new definition for confidentiality that addresses unsafety due to nondeterminism.
 \item Identification of required properties for preservation of confidentiality across implementation layers.
 \item A framework for proving new confidentiality property of multi-layer system implementations.
 \item A file system implementation with machine checkable proofs of confidentiality.
\end{itemize}
