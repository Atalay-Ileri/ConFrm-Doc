\section{Introduction}
As computation and storage paradigms shift toward the cloud, the safety of computation and data is becoming increasingly important. Users expect their data stored in such systems to stay secret against malicious third parties. Precise descriptions of how such a system should behave to ensure confidentiality of the stored data are called confidentiality specifications. A confidentiality specification of a system both forces a system to maintain certain properties, and informs users about the safety guarantees that system provides. 

Writing a confidentiality specification is generally more difficult than writing a correctness specification. To demonstrate the possible hardships of writing a specification that can prevent malicious implementations, we can look at a specification for the create() operation from our confidential file system ConFs. create() takes an owner and creates an empty file owned by the provided owner. Upon successful completion, it returns the inode number that points to that file. A natural correctness specification for its return value could be “create() returns the index of the previously unused inode that now corresponds to the newly created file.” If we were only interested in functional correctness, this could be an acceptable specification. However, there is a substantial confidentiality problem associated with it. create() is allowed to return any inode number as long as it was unused at the time of the call. A malicious implementation can take advantage of this nondeterminism in the specification to pick the returned inode number and subsequently leak confidential data (e.g. last byte of the return value being equal to the first byte of a block that belongs to another user).

This problem, and others of the same nature, could be solved by writing a fully deterministic specification for create() that exactly pinpoints what it should return and what the file-system state should be after its completion. However, such a specification would be overly verbose, obscuring the important parts of the specification, making it difficult to read and comprehend, and essentially defeating one of its key purposes. Therefore, a good confidentiality specification should address such vulnerabilities in its scope, but should also be clear and concise so it can be read, understood and reviewed by humans. Finding the right balance between these conflicting requirements is what makes writing a confidentiality specification challenging.

Our proposed solution to the above problems is ConFrm, a framework for 
implementing and proving the confidentiality of storage systems in a modular fashion. ConFrm provides a noninterference definition with better guarantees for nondeterministic behavior, as well as the required tools and necessary conditions for safety-preserving abstractions. These two components of ConFrm enable us to overcome the limitations of previous works and provide a simple yet powerful tool for implementing safe storage systems.


To test the capabilities of ConFrm, we implemented ConFS, a confidential file system that is crash-resistant via checksum logging, transactional operations, and coarse-grained discretionary access control. 

Both ConFrm and ConFS are implemented in Coq. All proofs are fully machine-checked to ensure their correctness.
